        This is why it is important to learn about the condition to effectively manage it.<br>

        <h3>WHAT IS DIABETES?</h3>
        <!--insert whimsical photo here-->
        <!--what even is a relevant diabetes photo-->
        <p>Diabetes is a complex health condition, where the body has very high sugar levels. 
            Normally, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that helps regulates the glucose (or sugar) 
            in your body and converts it into usable energy.</p>
        <p>There are 3 main types of diabetes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type 1 diabetes - wherein the body's immune system destroys the cells in the pancreas that produces the insulin.</li>
            <li>Type 2 diabetes - wherein the body no longer produces enough insulin or the body slowly 
                resists the insulin being produced.</li>
            <li>Gestational diabetes - occurs during pregnacy, usually disappears when the pregnancy ends.</li>
            <li>Pre-diabetes - the surprise 4th type, where the body blood sugar levels are higher than normal, 
                but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?</h3>
        <p>The following are some common symptoms that people with diabetes experiences, 
            and is not replaceable with a medical diagnosis. 
            Please consult a medical professional if you feel unwell.</p>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes is usually spotted early due to its sudden symptoms. Type 2 diabetes usually 
            exhibits no symptoms, or ones that go unnoticed for a long time.</p>
        <ul class="two-columns">
            <li>Excessive thirst or hunger</li>
