                <h4>MEET HENRY</h4>
                <p>Henry, Brisbane father of two, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in November of 2013. After a series 
                    of close calls between 2014-2016 from Insulin spikes,
                    Henry knew he needed a better way to track his health trends and identify early warning signs.</p>
                <p>After joining Diabetes@Home, Henry has regained confidence in his health. With historical data and easy
                     access to clinician advice, Henry can identify
                    early signs of danger, and request help from the convenience of his own home.</p>

                <h4>MEET JACK</h4>
                <p>Jack, working pro-bono lawyer and father of three, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in August of 
                    2016. With a very involved job and household responsibilities,
                    it became difficult to find time for diabetes management. </p>
                <p>After joining Diabetes@Home, Jack found support in managing his diabetes and keeping track of his 
                    health, despite the bustle of life. With the convenience of

                <h4>MEET KARL</h4>
                <p>Karl, a third year University of Melbourne student, has lived with type 2 diabetes all his life. As 
                    someone with volatile health, Karl has always valued 
                    the support of his primary clinician in Perth, as someone who understands Karl's situation well.</p>
                <p>After joining Diabetes@Home, and recording his health data through the app, Karl has managed to 
                    retain his patient clinician relationship. Despite the
                    distance, with the power of historical data and a messaging system, Karl can get the support he 
                    needs.</p>
