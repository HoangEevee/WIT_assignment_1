Assumptions and notes for patient (mobile) and clinical UI (desktop) screens:
Assumptions and notes for assignment 1: 

1. For the record health data screen, we have modelled the patient UI so that the patient fills
in all four data requirements including all blood glucose, exercise (step count), insulin doses, and weight. 
2. For the sign in options we have assumed that a new patient (who has alreay created their password) signs in autmomatically as a normal user would with their username (email) and their password. For a new user we have modelled the sign in so that they create a new password by themselves as this addresses the business requirement of "patients manage their own password" - this is how we understood that statement. Hence a new user would then have to create their new password if they are new to the system and go through a verification process which is seen in the other screens. 
3. For the patient UI 
4. For the clinical UI screen where the clincial has to monitor important comments from the patient: we have modelled this so that the comment which the paitent sends to the clinician is seen in the direct message screen. In this screen there is a message that says 'step count message' which is a particular message regarding the patients step count. This way the clinical can monitor what the paitent is saying in regards to their exercise, weight, blood glucose, or insulin doses. These 'important' messages are represented with a red notification dot instead of green.
5. For the clinical Ui in order for clinicians to specify which data each patient needs to input, a check-list on the patient page can be ticked or unticked to indicate which data is required. For project 1, it is assumed that patient Margaret Liel needs to input all 4 data.
